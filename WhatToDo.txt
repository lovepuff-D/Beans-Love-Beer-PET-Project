2. Update router paths to include the repository name.
The routes variable should look similar to the following:
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    redirect: { name: 'Home' }
  },
  {
    path: '/<REPO-NAME>/',
    name: 'Home',
    component: Home
  },
  {
    path: '/<REPO-NAME>/:queryParams(.*)',
    name: 'Result',
    component: Result,
    props: true
  }
